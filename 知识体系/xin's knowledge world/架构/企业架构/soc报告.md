# **What are Service Organization Controls (SOC) Reports?**

Service Organization Controls (SOC) reports help companies establish trust and confidence in their service delivery processes and controls. The reports are administered by an independent third party that must be a certified public accountant (CPA). The process of choosing the correct report among the three can be confusing task. That’s why we’ve broken it down for you, to help with your decision process.

服务组织控制 (SOC) 报告可帮助公司建立对其服务交付流程和控制的信任和信心。报告由必须是注册会计师 (CPA) 的独立第三方管理。在三者中选择正确报告的过程可能是一项令人困惑的任务。这就是我们为您分解的原因，以帮助您进行决策。

### What is a SOC 1 report?

Your company might need an SOC 1 report if it outsources services that affect the internal control over financial reporting (ICOFR) of another company. This report would enable a user auditor to evaluate audit risk associated with the use of a service organization. Examples of these businesses are payroll processing, software as a service, data center, and network monitoring services.

An auditor of a company’s financial statements or management of the service organization would use this report. Typically, these reports are utilized by financial statement auditors in reporting on internal control to comply with Sarbnes-Oxley Act (SOX) obligations.

```
如果您的公司外包影响其他公司财务报告内部控制 (ICOFR) 的服务，则您的公司可能需要一份 SOC 1 报告。该报告将使用户审计师能够评估与使用服务组织相关的审计风险。这些业务的示例包括工资单处理、软件即服务、数据中心和网络监控服务。

公司财务报表的审计师或服务机构的管理层会使用这份报告。通常，财务报表审计师利用这些报告来报告内部控制，以遵守 Sarbnes-Oxley 法案 (SOX) 的义务。
```

### What is a SOC 2 report?

While the SOC 1 report focuses on a company’s internal control over financial reporting, the SOC 2 report focuses on non-financial controls, such as, security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy. This report focuses on the Trust Service Principles (TSPs) and serves to educate the user entity about processes that affect its security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality or privacy of the data. Similar companies that may have a SOC 1 need a SOC 2 report as well, which include software as a service companies, data analytics companies and data center/colocation providers.

The users of this report would be anyone who:

- Knows about the nature of the service that’s provided by the service organization
- Knows how the service organization’s system interacts with user entities and other parties
- Knows internal control

```
SOC 1 报告侧重于公司对财务报告的内部控制，而 SOC 2 报告侧重于非财务控制，例如安全性、可用性、处理完整性、机密性和隐私。本报告侧重于信任服务原则 (TSP)，旨在向用户实体介绍影响其安全性、可用性、处理完整性、机密性或数据隐私的流程。可能拥有 SOC 1 的类似公司也需要一份 SOC 2 报告，其中包括软件即服务公司、数据分析公司和数据中心/托管服务提供商。

本报告的用户是符合以下条件的任何人：

- 了解服务组织提供的服务的性质
- 了解服务组织的系统如何与用户实体和其他方进行交互
- 了解内部控制
```

### Should I Choose a Type 1 or Type 2 report?

Both SOC 1 and SOC 2 reports can be performed as either Type 1 or Type 2 reports:

- Type 1 - report on the fairness of the presentation of management’s description of the service organization’s system and the suitability of the design of the controls to achieve the related control objectives included in the description as of a specified date (e.g. as of 12/31/15).
- Type 2 - report on the fairness of the presentation of management’s description of the service organization’s system and the suitability of the design and operating effectiveness of the controls to achieve the related control objectives included in the description throughout a specified period (e.g. 1/1/15 – 12/31/15).

```
SOC 1 和 SOC 2 报告都可以作为类型 1 或类型 2 报告执行：

- 类型 1 - 报告管理层对服务组织系统的描述的公平性以及控制设计的适用性，以实现截至指定日期（例如，截至 12/31 的描述中包含的相关控制目标） /15）。
- 类型 2 - 报告管理层对服务组织系统的描述的公平性以及控制设计和运行有效性的适用性，以在整个指定时期内实现描述中包含的相关控制目标（例如 1/1 /15 – 12/31/15）。
```

Type 2 reports will require additional efforts by both the service organization and the auditor, due to the fact that the testing of controls will be over a period of time as opposed to a point in time, as in a Type 1 report. Type 2 reports will require the auditor to conduct certain testing procedures, such as sample testing, which will provide an in-depth look at the control operation over a period of time and will require the service organization to produce documention to evidence operational effectiveness. Examples of testing might include completed security awareness training for a sample of employees hired during the review period or the termination checklists for a sample of employees terminated during the review period. It is common that service organizations who are new to the SOC examination process will choose to perform a either a readiness assessment (a gap assessment to prepare for a Type 1 or 2 report), a Type 1 report for the first year and in the subsequent years perform a Type 2 report. This will allow the service organization to work with the auditor to gain a familiarity with the audit process and prepare them for a successful Type 2 examination.

```
类型 2 报告需要服务组织和审计师都付出额外的努力，因为控制测试将在一段时间内进行，而不是在类型 1 报告中的某个时间点。类型 2 报告将要求审计师执行某些测试程序，例如样本测试，这将深入了解一段时间内的控制操作，并要求服务组织提供文件以证明操作有效性。测试的示例可能包括针对在审查期间雇用的员工样本完成的安全意识培训或针对在审查期间被解雇的员工样本的解雇清单。初次接触 SOC 考试流程的服务组织通常会选择执行准备情况评估（准备第 1 类或第 2 类报告的差距评估）、第一年和随后的第 1 类报告年执行类型 2 报告。这将允许服务组织与审核员合作，以熟悉审核流程并为成功的 2 类考试做好准备。
```



### What is a SOC 3 report?

The SOC 3 report, like the SOC 2 report, focuses on the TSPs, but can be freely distributed because it only reports on whether the entity has met all the Trust Services criteria. No test results or opinions are included in the report. The SOC 3 report can be used or read by anyone. As of 2014, a company can no longer place a seal of completion on its website, this has caused the SOC 3 report to lose some popularity.

```
SOC 3 报告与 SOC 2 报告一样，侧重于 TSP，但可以自由分发，因为它仅报告实体是否满足所有信任服务标准。报告中不包含任何测试结果或意见。任何人都可以使用或阅读 SOC 3 报告。到 2014 年，一家公司不能再在其网站上盖上完成印章，这导致 SOC 3 报告失去了一些人气。
```

### What are the TSPs?

TSPs are a core set of principles and criteria that address the risks and opportunities of IT-enabled systems and privacy programs. The following principles and related criteria are used by practitioners in the performance of SOC 2 engagements:

- Security: The system is protected against unauthorized access (both physical and logical).
- Availability: The system is available for operation and use as committed or agreed.
- Processing Integrity. System processing is complete, accurate, timely, and authorized.
- Confidentiality: Information designated as confidential is protected as committed or agreed.
- Privacy: Personal information is collected, used, retained, disclosed and destroyed in conformity with the commitments in the entity’s privacy notice and with criteria set forth in Generally Accepted Privacy Principles issued by the AICPA and CICA. The TSPC of security, availability and processing integrity are used to evaluate whether a system is reliable.

```
TSP 是一套核心原则和标准，用于解决 IT 支持的系统和隐私计划的风险和机遇。从业人员在执行 SOC 2 业务时使用以下原则和相关标准：

- 安全性：系统受到保护，防止未经授权的访问（物理和逻辑）。
- 可用性：系统可以按照承诺或约定进行操作和使用。
- 加工完整性。系统处理完整、准确、及时、授权。
- 机密性：指定为机密的信息按照承诺或约定受到保护。
- 隐私：个人信息的收集、使用、保留、披露和销毁符合实体隐私声明中的承诺以及 AICPA 和 CICA 发布的普遍接受的隐私原则中规定的标准。安全性、可用性和处理完整性的 TSPC 用于评估系统是否可靠。
```

### Which SOC report is right for me?

Choosing which SOC report is the best option for your organization can often be a difficult task. It is not uncommon that service organizations can benefit from multiple SOC reports, due to the fact that user entities could have an interest in both the internal controls over financial reporting from a SOC 1 as well as non-financial controls such as security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and/or privacy from a SOC 2. It is important to understand your market as a service organization and listen to the concerns of both current and potential customers prior to dedicing which SOC report would be of the most benefit to your organization.

```
选择哪种 SOC 报告最适合您的组织通常是一项艰巨的任务。服务组织可以从多个 SOC 报告中受益的情况并不少见，因为用户实体可能对来自 SOC 1 的财务报告的内部控制以及非财务控制（例如安全性、可用性、处理来自 SOC 的完整性、机密性和/或隐私 2。在决定哪个 SOC 报告对您最有利之前，了解您的市场即服务组织并听取当前和潜在客户的担忧非常重要组织。
